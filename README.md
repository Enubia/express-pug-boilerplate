# express-ts-boilerplate

So you want to start a new cool side project which you never going to finish anyways?

You would like to use express and typescript, maybe even a little template engine sprinkled on top?

But you think: "Damn, the setup is tedious and annoying, takes too much time and this way I'll never finish my cool little side project (which I'm not going to finish anyways, lets be real)"

## Look no further

this boilerplate comes packed with everything you need

typescript for some awesome syntax sugar, even all the gen-z kids will approve that

express as your go-to server

pug as a template engine (this one can be replace with anything you find fancy tho)

a gulp build pipeline to compile your SCSS and client side JS files into minified files to be served

and of course, hot reloading for you development environment

## getting started

```
git clone git@github.com:Enubia/express-ts-boilerplate.git
```

change the remote to your own repository

change the name of the project

adapt the package.json and you're good to go

to start the dev server run 

```
npm run dev
```

to build everthing run

```
npm run build
```
